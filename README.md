This mod allows for trading with Villagers with just one click. It's great for quickly trading entire double chests of crops to farmers, or Paper to librarians. 

Villager Trading Plus works clientside, and does not need to be installed on the server.

You can trade normally by sneaking.

## Installation

ClickThrough Plus is a completely clientside mod for Fabric and NeoForge.
- On Fabric, [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) is required.
- On NeoForge, no dependencies are required.
- Mod settings are available with [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/mod-menu) (only required on Fabric) and [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config).

If it's not obvious, this is a port of Giselbaer's Easy Villager Trading to Architectury 1.21, allowing for the mod to be used on both loaders. Easy Villager Trading is available under the [MIT License](https://github.com/gbl/EasierVillagerTrading/blob/fabric_1_20/LICENSE).

Mod Menu/Cloth Config integration is based on the integration present in [idwtialsimmoedm](https://modrinth.com/mod/idwtialsimmoedm) under its [MIT License](https://github.com/gliscowo/idwtialsimmoedm/blob/1.21/LICENSE).
