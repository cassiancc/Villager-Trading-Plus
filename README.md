This mod helps you access containers (Chests, Shulker Boxes, Barrels, etc.) that are marked with a Sign or Item Frame. Right-clicking a sign or item frame that's attached to a container will open the container instead.

ClickThrough Plus works clientside, and does not need to be installed on the server.

You can still rotate items in item frames by sneaking and clicking them.

## Installation

ClickThrough Plus is a completely clientside mod for Fabric and NeoForge.
- On Fabric, [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) and [Architectury API](https://modrinth.com/mod/architectury-api) is required.
- On NeoForge, [Architectury API](https://modrinth.com/mod/architectury-api) is required.
- Mod settings are available with [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/mod-menu) (only required on Fabric) and [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config).

## Credits

If it's not obvious, this is a port of Giselbaer's ClickThrough to Architectury 1.21, allowing for the mod to be used on both loaders. ClickThrough is available under the [MIT License](https://github.com/gbl/ClickThrough/blob/fabric_1_20/LICENSE).

Mod Menu/Cloth Config integration is based on the integration present in [idwtialsimmoedm](https://modrinth.com/mod/idwtialsimmoedm) under its [MIT License](https://github.com/gliscowo/idwtialsimmoedm/blob/1.21/LICENSE).
